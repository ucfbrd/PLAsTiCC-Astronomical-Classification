## Abstract
 In this project, we design, test, validate and implement different classification algorithms as part of the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge. Specifically, we implement a recurrent neural network, a gradient boosting tree and an optimal decision tree algorithm to compare these methodologies and ultimately combine them into an ensemble method to generate better results.
